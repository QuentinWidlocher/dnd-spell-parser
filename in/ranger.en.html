You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.
<br />A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Animal Friendship</h1><div class="ecole">level 1 - enchantment</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a morsel of food)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 24 hours</div><div class="description ">This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Animal Messenger</h1><div class="ecole">level 2 - enchantment (ritual)</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a morsel of food)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 24 hours</div><div class="description ">By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.
<br />When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

The spell fails if the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher. Until the spell ends, the link is active while you and the beast are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you. While the link is active, the beast gains advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that you can see.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte"><h1>Beast Sense</h1><div class="ecole">level 2 - divination (ritual)</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 hour</div><div class="description ">You touch a willing beast. For the duration of the spell, you can use your action to see through the beast's eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. While perceiving through the beast's senses, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by that creature, though you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn't function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.
<br />You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:
<br />• terrain and bodies of water
<br />• prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
<br />• powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead

Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures' statistics.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.

<br />If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.
<br />You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.
<br />If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

<br />You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration.

<br />If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.
