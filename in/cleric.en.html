        <div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 minute</div>
        <div><strong>Range</strong>: 10 feet</div>
        <div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)</div>
        <div><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</div>
        <div class="description ">This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you
            chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).
            <br />On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time,
            issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands,
            the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
            <br />The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour
            period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.
            <br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures
            must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

        <h1>Antimagic Field</h1>
        <div class="ecole">level 8 - abjuration</div>
        <div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div>
        <div><strong>Range</strong>: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)</div>
        <div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)</div>
        <div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 hour</div>
        <div class="description ">A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane.
            Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
            <br />Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't
            function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.
            <br /><strong><em>Targeted Effects</em></strong>. Spells and other magical effects, such as <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=magic-missile">magic missile</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=charm-person">charm person</a></em>,
            that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.
            <br /><strong><em>Areas of Magic</em></strong>. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=fireball">fireball</a></em>, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an
            area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=wall-of-fire">wall of fire</a></em> are suppressed within the sphere,
            creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.
            <br /><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.
            <br /><strong><em>Magic Items</em></strong>. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.
            <br />A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you
            fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
            <br /><strong><em>Magical Travel</em></strong>. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane
            of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=rope-trick">rope trick</a></em> spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.
            <br /><strong><em>Creatures and Objects</em></strong>. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer
            within the sphere.
            <br /><strong><em>Dispel Magic</em></strong>. Spells and magical effects such as <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em> have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different
            <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=antimagic-field">antimagic field</a></em> spells don't nullify each other.

        <h1>Astral Projection</h1>
        <div class="ecole">level 9 - necromancy</div>
        <div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 hour</div>
        <div><strong>Range</strong>: 10 feet</div>
        <div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)</div>
        <div><strong>Duration</strong>: Special</div>
        <div class="description ">You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state
            of suspended animation; it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.
            <br />Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind
            you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states
            that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
            <br />Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions
            are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they
            persist when you return to it.
            <br />The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.
            <br />The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em> spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for
            that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its
            state of suspended animation.
            <br />If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.

        <div class="description ">By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the
            next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
            <br />• Weal, for good results
            <br />• Woe, for bad results
            <br />• Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
            <br />• Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad
            <br />The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
            <br />If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

            the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
            <br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

        <div class="description ">You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.
            <br />If the target is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears
            in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
            <br />If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you're on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the
            space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.
            <br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

        <div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div>
        <div class="description ">You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
            <br />• Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
            <br />• While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
            <br />• While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
            <br />• While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.
            <br />A <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=remove-curse">remove curse</a></em> spell ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described

            <br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If
            you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.

        <div class="description ">You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up
            to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.
            <br />When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature

            If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
            <br />You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
            <br />Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When

            <br />Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target is prevented from following your command, the spell ends.
            <br /><strong><em>Approach</em></strong>. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
            <br /><strong><em>Drop</em></strong>. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
            <br /><strong><em>Flee</em></strong>. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
            <br /><strong><em>Grovel</em></strong>. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

        <div class="description ">You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.
            <br />Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary
            to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
            <br />If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.

        <div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)</div>
        <div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
        <div class="description ">Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the
            same effect or choose a different one.
            <br /><strong><em>Flood</em></strong>. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large
            body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles
            struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood
            effect lasts.
            <br /><strong><em>Part Water</em></strong>. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell
            ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.
            <br /><strong><em>Redirect Flow</em></strong>. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you
            direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
            <br /><strong><em>Whirlpool</em></strong>. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base,
            up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your
            spell save DC.
            <br />When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends.
            On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics)
            check to do so.
            <br />The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

        <div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div>
        <div class="description ">You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact
            with the ground in that area.
            <br />The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.
            <br />When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
            <br />This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
            <br /><strong><em>Fissures</em></strong>. Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet
            wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's
            edge as it opens.
            <br />A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).
            <br /><strong><em>Structures</em></strong>. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure
            drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked
            prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
            damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

        <h1>Glyph of Warding</h1>
        <div class="ecole">level 3 - abjuration</div>
        <div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 hour</div>
        <div><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</div>
        <div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)</div>
        <div><strong>Duration</strong>: Until dispelled or triggered</div>
        <div class="description ">When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal
            the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
            <br />The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
            <br />You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain
            distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing
            or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
            <br />You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or
            drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
            <br />When you inscribe the glyph, choose <em>explosive runes</em> or a <em>spell glyph</em>.
            <br /><strong>Explosive Runes</strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.
            A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
            <br /><strong>Spell Glyph</strong>. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate
            effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell
            summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
            <br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a <em>spell glyph</em>,
            you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the <em>glyph of warding</em>.

            <br />First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can't enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed,

            all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
            it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.
            <br /><strong><em>Courage</em></strong>. Affected creatures can't be frightened while in the area.
            <br /><strong><em>Darkness</em></strong>. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't illuminate the area.

            <br /><strong><em>Everlasting Rest</em></strong>. Dead bodies interred in the area can't be turned into undead.

            <br />Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:
            <br />• The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
            <br />• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
            <br />• Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.
            <br />When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

        <div class="description ">You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature
            appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).
            <br />When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly
            us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.
            <br />Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service
            for a quest undertaken by you.
            <br />As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM
            can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested
            payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
            <br />After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.
            <br />If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.
            <br />A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

            magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or
            created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.
            <br />A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions,
            but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same

            from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM's discretion.
            <br />Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear

            as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist. Instead of targeting a creature,
            you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

        <div><strong>Duration</strong>: Until dispelled or triggered</div>
        <div class="description ">When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose
            a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is
            broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
            <br />The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.
            <br />You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance
            of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.
            <br />You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect
            hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
            <br />When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere
            when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
            <br /><strong>Death</strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.
            <br /><strong>Discord</strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage
            on attack rolls and ability checks.
            <br /><strong>Fear</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on
            each of its turns, if able.
            <br /><strong>Hopelessness</strong>. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells,
            or other magical effects.
            <br /><strong>Insanity</strong>. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read,
            and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.
            <br /><strong>Pain</strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.
            <br /><strong>Sleep</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.
            <br /><strong>Stunning</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.
