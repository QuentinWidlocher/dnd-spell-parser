You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte"><h1>Acid Splash</h1><div class="ecole">level 0 - conjuration</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</div><div class="description ">You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature you can see within range, or choose two creatures you can see within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.
<br />This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target's hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.

Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.
<br />A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.
<br /><strong><em>Aquatic Adaptation</em></strong>. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
<br /><strong><em>Change Appearance</em></strong>. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.
<br /><strong><em>Natural Weapons</em></strong>. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.

Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.
<br />As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

<br />An animated object is a construct witd AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.
<br />If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Arcane Eye</h1><div class="ecole">level 4 - divination</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 hour</div><div class="description ">You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.
<br />You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.
<br />As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Arcane Lock</h1><div class="ecole">level 2 - abjuration</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Until dispelled</div><div class="description ">You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=knock">knock</a></em> on the object suppresses <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=arcane-lock">arcane lock</a></em> for 10 minutes.
<br />While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Bigby's Hand</h1><div class="ecole">level 5 - evocation</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><div class="description ">You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.
<br />The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space.
<br />When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.
<br /><strong>Clenched Fist</strong>. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
<br /><strong>Forceful Hand</strong>. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
<br /><strong>Grasping Hand</strong>. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
<br /><strong>Interposing Hand</strong>. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Blink</h1><div class="ecole">level 3 - transmutation</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Self</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</div><div class="description ">Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.
<br />While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Booming Blade</h1><div class="ecole">level 0 - evocation</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Self (5-foot radius)</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round</div><div class="description ">You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.
<br />This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Catapult</h1><div class="ecole">level 1 - transmutation</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</div><div class="description ">Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 pounds, and the damage increases by 1d8, for each slot level above 1st.

Until the spells ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it move into the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
<br />The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.
<br />The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte"><h1>Create Food and Water</h1><div class="ecole">level 3 - conjuration</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</div><div class="description ">You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours.

You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.
<br />The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

<br />Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
<br />As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.
<br />The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
<br />The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
<br />To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

Moreover, the target loses any resistance to that damage type until the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

<br /><strong>Bear's Endurance</strong>. The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends.
<br /><strong>Bull's Strength</strong>. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.
<br /><strong>Cat's Grace</strong>. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn't incapacitated.

Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
<br />If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.
<br /><strong>Enlarge</strong>. The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
<br /><strong>Reduce</strong>. The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
<br />The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
<br />You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
<br />You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
<br />When you inscribe the glyph, choose <em>explosive runes</em> or a <em>spell glyph</em>.
<br /><strong>Explosive Runes</strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
<br /><strong>Spell Glyph</strong>. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a <em>spell glyph</em>, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the <em>glyph of warding</em>.

When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.
<br />At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.

The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.
<br />When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:
<br />• Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
<br />• The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision through it.
<br />• Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
<br />• Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.
<br />• Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
<br />• Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.
<br />Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.

The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.
<br />The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.
<br />A <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=disintegrate">disintegrate</a></em> spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

<br /><strong>Transmute Rock to Mud</strong>. Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.
<br />The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.
<br />If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
<br /><strong>Transmute Mud to Rock</strong>. Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface to an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Wall of Stone</h1><div class="ecole">level 5 - evocation</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a small block of granite)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div><div class="description ">A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
<br />If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
<br />The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
<br />If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.
<br />The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.
<br />If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.
<br />If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
<br />Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
<br />A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
<br />The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
