Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Animal Messenger</h1><div class="ecole">level 2 - enchantment (ritual)</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a morsel of food)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 24 hours</div><div class="description ">By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.
<br />When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.
<br />As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
<br /><table><tr><th>Size</th><th>HP</th><th>AC</th><th>Attack</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th></tr><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>20</td><td>18</td><td>+8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage</td><td>4</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>25</td><td>16</td><td>+6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage</td><td>6</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>40</td><td>13</td><td>+5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage</td><td>10</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>50</td><td>10</td><td>+6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage</td><td>14</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>80</td><td>10</td><td>+8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage</td><td>18</td><td>6</td></tr></table>
<br />An animated object is a construct witd AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.
<br />If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Awaken</h1><div class="ecole">level 5 - transmutation</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 8 hours</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</div><div class="description ">After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=awakened-shrub">awakened shrub</a> or the <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=awakened-tree">awakened tree</a>.
<br />The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Bane</h1><div class="ecole">level 1 - enchantment</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a drop of blood)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><div class="description ">Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Bestow curse</h1><div class="ecole">level 3 - necromancy</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><div class="description ">You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
<br />• Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
<br />• While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
<br />• While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
<br />• While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.
<br />A <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=remove-curse">remove curse</a></em> spell ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse's effect.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte"><h1>Blade Ward</h1><div class="ecole">level 0 - abjuration</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Self</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round</div><div class="description ">You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Blindness/Deafness</h1><div class="ecole">level 2 - necromancy</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</div><div class="description ">You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Calm Emotions</h1><div class="ecole">level 2 - enchantment</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><div class="description ">You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
<br />You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
<br />Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Clairvoyance</h1><div class="ecole">level 3 - divination</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 10 minutes</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 1 mile</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div><div class="description ">You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.
<br />When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.
<br />A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=see-invisibility">see invisibility</a></em> or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.

A creature takes 4d4 slashing damage when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.
<br />This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Compulsion</h1><div class="ecole">level 4 - enchantment</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><div class="description ">Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can't be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving to try to end the effect.
<br />A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Confusion</h1><div class="ecole">level 4 - enchantment</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 90 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (three nut shells)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><div class="description ">This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
<br />An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
<br /><table><tr><th class="center">d10</th><th>Behavior</th></tr><tr><td class="center">1</td><td>The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction.

<br />At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Crown of Madness</h1><div class="ecole">level 2 - enchantment</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><p class="warning">Description not available (not OGL).

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Dancing Lights</h1><div class="ecole">level 0 - evocation</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><div class="description ">You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
<br />As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteP"><h1>Detect Magic</h1><div class="ecole">level 1 - divination (ritual)</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Self</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div><div class="description ">For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.
<br />The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Detect Thoughts</h1><div class="ecole">level 2 - divination</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Self</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a copper piece)</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</div><div class="description ">For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.
<br />You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.
<br />Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
<br />You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.
<br />Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Dimension Door</h1><div class="ecole">level 4 - conjuration</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 500 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</div><div class="description ">You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet."
<br />You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
<br />If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Disguise Self</h1><div class="ecole">level 1 - illusion</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: Self</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour</div><div class="description ">You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
<br />The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
<br />To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTP"><h1>Dispel Magic</h1><div class="ecole">level 3 - abjuration</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</div><div class="description ">Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Dissonant Whispers</h1><div class="ecole">level 1 - enchantment</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</div><div class="description ">You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
<br /></div></div><div class="blocCarte blocCarteTTP"><h1>Dominate Monster</h1><div class="ecole">level 8 - enchantment</div><div><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</div><div><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</div><div><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</div><div><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 hour</div><div class="description ">You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
<br />While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
<br />You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
<br />Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
<br />While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
<br />You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
<br />Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new

<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.

Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.
<br />If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.
<br />You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.
<br />If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.

If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.
<br />While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.
<br />You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.
<br />When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy.

<br /><strong>Asleep</strong>. The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.
<br /><strong>Panicked</strong>. The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move.

<br />A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
<br />A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
<br />When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.
<br />A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect.

A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.
<br />You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
<br />The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
<br />You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
<br />You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
<br />When you inscribe the glyph, choose <em>explosive runes</em> or a <em>spell glyph</em>.
<br /><strong>Explosive Runes</strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
<br /><strong>Spell Glyph</strong>. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a <em>spell glyph</em>, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the <em>glyph of warding</em>.

The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.
<br />When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
<br /><em>Guards and wards</em> creates the following effects within the warded area.
<br /><strong>Corridors</strong>. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
<br /><strong>Doors</strong>. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=arcane-lock">arcane lock</a></em> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=minor-illusion">minor illusion</a></em> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
<br /><strong>Stairs</strong>. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=web">web</a></em> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while <em>guards and wards</em> lasts.
<br /><strong>Other Spell Effect</strong>. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.
<br />• Place <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=dancing-lights">dancing lights</a></em> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.

<br />• Place <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=stinking-cloud">stinking cloud</a></em> in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while <em>guards and wards</em> lasts.
<br />• Place a constant <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a></em> in one corridor or room.

Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.
<br />The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it.

Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
<br />When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
<br />The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).
<br />As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
<br />Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

<br />You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.
<br />You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.
<br />While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.
<br />You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.
<br />A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.
<br />A <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=remove-curse">remove curse</a></em> or <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=greater-restoration">greater restoration</a></em> spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).

You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
<br />Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
<br />You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

It lasts for the duration.
<br />When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this spell.
<br />A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
<br />The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
<br />The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
<br />While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
<br />An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.
<br />A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
<br /><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.

There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.
<br />If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.
<br />You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.
<br />If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
<br />The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
<br />The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
<br />The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by he nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
<br />The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

<br />• You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
<br />• You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.

<br />• You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
<br />• You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
<br />When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.
<br />The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.
<br />Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
<br />The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
<br />The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
<br />You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
<br />Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day.

The corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
<br />Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.
<br />You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.
<br />Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.
<br />If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.
<br />Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.
<br />A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
<br />The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
<br />You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.
<br />If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
<br />The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.
<br />You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.
<br />You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
<br />When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
<br /><strong>Death</strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.
<br /><strong>Discord</strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
<br /><strong>Fear</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.
<br /><strong>Hopelessness</strong>. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.
<br /><strong>Insanity</strong>. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.
<br /><strong>Pain</strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.
<br /><strong>Sleep</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.
<br /><strong>Stunning</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

<br />The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.

<br /><strong><em>Familiarity</em></strong>. "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
<br />"Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.
<br />"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
<br />"Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.
<br />"Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic.
<br />"Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.
<br />"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
<br /><strong><em>On Target</em></strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.
<br /><strong><em>Off Target</em></strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
<br /><strong><em>Similar Area</em></strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
<br /><strong><em>Mishap</em></strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
<br />Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
<br />You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

Each creature within range, other than you, must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage.
<br />The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
<br />In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.
<br />This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.
<br /><strong>Creature into Creature</strong>. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
<br />The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
<br />The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.
<br />The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
<br /><strong>Object into Creature</strong>. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.
<br />If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.
<br /><strong>Creature into Object</strong>. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object's size is no larger than the creature's size. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.

Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
<br />An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
